# git-secrets
These are utility scripts for developers of the DVE to ensure that no secrets are committed to the repository. To be able to contribute to the repository you must ensure that this tool is installed on your machine.

I have taken these installation instructions directly from the [NHSD Software Engineering Quality Framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/tree/main/tools/nhsd-git-secrets).
